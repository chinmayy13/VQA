# 🤖 Visual Question Answering (VQA) with Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **Visual Question Answering (VQA) system** that allows users to ask natural language questions about an image and receive accurate answers.  
It combines **Computer Vision (CV)** for image understanding, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for question parsing and answer generation, and **Deep Learning** using state-of-the-art transformers.

The project uses **BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) VQA model**, pre-trained on large-scale vision-language datasets, providing a powerful starting point for reasoning over images.

---

## 🚀 Features

-  Ask questions about any image and receive accurate answers
-  Works with **local images** or **image URLs**
-  Leverages **transformers + PyTorch** for cutting-edge performance
-  Can be extended into **interactive web apps** (Gradio/Streamlit)
-  Serves as a foundation for **multimodal AI projects** like Visual Reasoning, Image Captioning, and Multimodal Chatbots

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Deep Learning Framework**: PyTorch
- **NLP + CV Models**: Hugging Face Transformers (BLIP-VQA)
- **Image Processing**: Pillow
- _(Optional)_: Gradio/Streamlit for interactive web demo
